      </p>

        <p class="under-title">Reasons you may want to buy a gaming PC could be that you are wanting to upgrade your current pc because
          it is too old, you may want to start playing games or doing more intense tasks such as video editing etc.
          This website is designed to help people interested in upgrading and building PC's for your need.

      <div class="grid-item"><p>The CPU, often referred to as the brain of the computer, is responsible for executing instructions and performing calculations needed for various tasks and programs.
        In gaming, the CPU handles critical tasks like game physics, artificial intelligence (AI) computations, and managing the game's logic.
        When choosing a CPU for gaming, consider factors like clock speed (measured in gigahertz) and the number of cores and threads. A higher clock speed and more cores generally result in better gaming performance.
        </p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="grid-item"><p>The GPU is like a powerhouse for rendering graphics. It processes complex calculations to produce images, animations, and videos that you see on your screen.
        In gaming, the GPU's role is paramount. A powerful gaming GPU ensures high frame rates and visually stunning graphics.
        Key factors to consider when selecting a GPU include VRAM (video RAM), CUDA cores (for NVIDIA cards), and stream processors (for AMD cards). Higher VRAM and more processing units lead to better gaming performance.</p>
      </div>  
      <div class="grid-item">The motherboard is the main circuit board that hosts and connects all the components in a computer.
        It accommodates the CPU, GPU, RAM, storage drives, and other essential hardware. It also provides interfaces for connecting external devices.
        Ensure the motherboard is compatible with your CPU and GPU, and it has enough ports and slots to accommodate your components.
      </div>
      <div class="grid-item">RAM is the computer's short-term memory, storing data and instructions that the CPU needs quickly. It's much faster than reading data from storage.
        For gaming, having ample RAM (measured in gigabytes) allows you to run multiple applications simultaneously and ensures smooth gameplay by reducing lags and delays.</div>
      <div class="grid-item">Storage drives are where you store your operating system, games, applications, and files.
        Solid State Drives (SSDs) are faster than traditional Hard Disk Drives (HDDs), resulting in quicker boot times, faster game loading, and more responsive system performance.</div>  
      <div class="grid-item">The PSU converts electricity from your wall outlet into usable power for your computer components.
        Choose a PSU with sufficient wattage to power all your hardware. Consider the power requirements of your CPU, GPU, and other components when making your choice.</div>
      <div class="grid-item">Efficient cooling is vital to prevent components from overheating and causing potential damage.
        A CPU cooler keeps the CPU temperature in check during intensive gaming sessions, ensuring optimal performance. Additional case fans help maintain airflow, further aiding in cooling.</div>
      <div class="grid-item">The computer case houses and protects all the internal components of your PC.
        It comes in various sizes and designs, offering different levels of space and cooling options. Ensure the case you choose can fit all your components comfortably.</div>
      <div class="grid-item">Peripherals are external devices you connect to your PC for interaction and display.
        Key peripherals for gaming include a high-quality keyboard, a precise mouse, and a fast refresh rate monitor for a better gaming experience.</div>
