        <p class="under-title">Reasons you may want to buy a gaming PC could be that you are wanting to upgrade your current pc because
          it is too old, you may want to start playing games or doing more intense tasks such as video editing etc.
          This website is designed to help people interested in upgrading and building PC's for your need.

      <div class="grid-item">First we should talk about the CPU or the Central Processing Unit, this is a small chip in every computer which is 
        what makes your computer run. The CPU is what is sending information from one part of your computer therefore the faster the chip,
        the faster you will be able to do activities. For games such as Valorant or CS:GO they will actually get far more frames per second
        as they are more CPU intensive while games like Shadow Of The Tomb Raider is much more GPU intensive.
      </div>
      <div class="grid-item">Next we should talk about the the GPU you are using which is short for Graphics Processing Unit.
        The GPU is one of the most important parts of any gaming PC and what it does is graphics cards are what renders the images from
      your computer over to your monitor, the more powerful the graphics card, the higher your ingame graphics will be. For example if I were
      to play a game called Shadow Of The Tomb Raider on my computer and I had a GTX 970 on Maximum ingame settings then it would give 
      us around 45fps at 1080P but if I swapped my Nvidia Gefore GTX 970 out for an Nvidia RTX 4090 then I would easily get over 150fps
      on the same game at 4K. One thing you need to remember though is that most people wouldnt be playing at 4K and for games as demanding
      as shadow of the tomb raider FPS doesnt really matter as it isnt a fast paced shooter game like Valorant and CS:GO. </div>  
      <div class="grid-item">One of the absolute most important components of any PC is the motherboard, a motherboard is a platform which 
        every component plugs into to work together. Depending on how much you end up spending on the motherboard, it may come with features
        like Wifi and bluetooth or even Thunderbolt if you are lucky. The one thing that you must know about motherboards are that they only
        work with specific components such as only some CPU's or RAM may work or be compatible with some motherboards.

    <div>This Section teaches you more about what a CPU is and how it works</div>
    <p>If you were to buy a CPU that reaches around 5ghz that means that it is most likely a high performance CPU but with great power also means you will require good cooling especially if your cpu is overclockable or if your cpu has multiple cores running and boosting upto that speed.</p>
